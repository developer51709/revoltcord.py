# revoltcord.py Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **revoltcord.py**, a Python compatibility layer designed to let Discord.py‑style bots run on the Revolt chat platform with little to no code changes.

This project aims to make bot migration from Discord to Revolt effortless by recreating the familiar Discord.py API on top of Revolt’s REST and WebSocket systems.

revoltcord.py is:

- A **drop‑in compatibility layer** for Discord.py bot code  
- A **Python library** that translates Discord.py calls into Revolt API calls  
- A tool for **self‑hosted communities** who want Discord‑style bots on Revolt  
- Fully **open‑source** and community‑driven
